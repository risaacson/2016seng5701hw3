        <title>How is DocBook organized?</title>
        <para>
Written DocBook like other XML is set up in a hierarchical tree of nested elements. The basic forms are for example a &lt;book&gt; or an &lt;article&gt;. A collection of books could be gathered into a &lt;set&gt;. A book could contain &lt;part&gt;s, &lt;chapter&gt;s and &lt;section&gt;s amongst many other elements. Elements such as &lt;para&gt; (paragraphs) could be under many parent elements.
